# fume

Python implementation of the Steam client protocol.

This was developed while running on fumes.

This is very much a pre-alpha dump of code.  It doesn't even have an actual client yet.

## Installation

```
pip install "fume @ git+https://github.com/nosoop/fume"
```

The base installation only contains the data structures and serialization routines needed to
communicate with Steam servers.

Client someday?
